function [V, mirM] = sw_mirror(n, V)
% mirrors a 3D vector
%
% [V, mirM] = SW_MIRROR(n, {V}) 
%
% It mirrors the vectors in V to the mirror plane that is defined by its
% normal vector mNorm.
%
% Input:
%
% n         Vector, normal to the mirror plane, dimensions are [1 3].
% V         Matrix of 3D vectors, dimensions are [3 N], optional.
%
% Output:
%
% V         Mirrored vectors, dimensions are [3 N].
% mirM      Matrix of the mirror operation, dimensions are [3 3].
%
% To mirror any column vector use the following:
%   vp = mirM * v;
%
% To apply mirror plane operation on tensors (3x3 matrices) use the
% following command:
%   Ap = mirM * A * mirM';
%
% See also SW.GENMAGSTR, SW_ROT.
