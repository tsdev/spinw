## Requirements and Installation

### What you need

SpinW can be used in two different ways:
* The best is to run it from a recent version of [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) (newer than R2014a), however this requires a valid license.
* The alternative way is to run pySpinW from [Python](https://www.python.org) which does not require Matlab license and it can also be used for distributed computing.

The symbolic calculation mode also needs the [Symbolic Math Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/symbolic.html) installed.

### Installation

The latest version of SpinW can be downloaded from [https://github.com/tsdev/spinw/releases](https://github.com/tsdev/spinw/releases. Steps to install:
* extract the `.zip` file into any local folder
* add the folder to the Matlab search path using `addpath(genpath(MYSPINWFOLDER))`
* recommended to copy the above command into the `startup.m` file

### Updating

Since SpinW is under active development, there are regular updates (new features, bug fixes). To update your local copy of SpinW do the following:
* execute the [sw_update] function in the Matlab Command Window, this will check for the latest available version and downloads it into a new subfolder beside the current SpinW installation ([sw_rootdir] returns the current path) and adds the new files to the Matlab search path
* to make the new path permanent, edit your `startup.m` file as written above
* execute the `clear classes` command in the Command Window to clear the Matlab cache of user defined classes


## Hello World!

It is possible to create, solve and plot a spin wave model in a single line of code using SpinW! For example the following line will solve the spin wave dispersion of the triangular lattice antiferromagnet (TLA) along the $(h,h,0)$ direction in reciprocal space:

```
>>sw_plotspec(spinwave(sw_model('triAF',1),{[0 0 0] [1 1 0]}))
>>snapnow
```

This line includes 3 functions:
* [sw_model] generates one of the predefined spin Hamiltonians, in this case a TLA with $J=1$ meV first neighbor antiferromagnetic exchange
* [spinw.spinwave] calculates the spin wave dispersion between the $(0,0,0)$ and $(1,1,0)$ reciprocal space points
* [sw_plotspec] plots the spin wave dispersion

The following documentation will show how to prepare more complicated spin Hamiltonians.


## Get help

The fastest way to get help is to access this documentation via the [swdoc] command. To jump directly to the help of a specific function use:
```
swdoc funName
```
Alternatively the [swhelp] command will show the help text in the MATLAB Command Window that works the same way as the MATLAB built-in [matlab:help] command:

```
swhelp funName
```
If you didn't find the answer, you can ask questions on the [SpinW Forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!categories/spinwforum) as well.

If you find a bug, please submit a bug report on [GitHub](https://github.com/tsdev/spinw), this is the fastest route to have it fixed. 

## Handle Class

The central part of SpinW is the [spinw] object which stores the spin Hamiltonian and defines operations on it. It is important to know that unlike most Matlab variable, the [spinw] object is [handle class](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_oop/handle-objects.html) type. This means that a simple copy command:
```
swobj2 = swobj1
```
just creates a copy of the handle, but still `swobj1` and `swobj2` will point to the same location in memory. To disentangle the two variables, the [spinw.copy] method will do:
```
swobj3 = swobj1.copy
```
now `swobj3` is an independent copy of `swobj1`.


The main advantages of handle class:
* object methods can be called as
  ```
  obj.method(parameter)
  ```
  for non-handle classes the returned object has to be saved:
  ```
  obj = method(obj,parameter)
  ```
* working with handle classes saves memory, as we create a copy of the object less often

## Matrix dimensions

Since Matlab is optimized for working with arrays efficiently, many of input and output arguments of the [spinw] methods take multidimensional arrays. Thus it is important to introduce some definitions. Throughout the documentation the word matrix will refer to multidimensional arrays where the dimensions are denoted in square brackets, e.g. $[3\times n_{atom}]$ means a matrix with 3 rows and variable number of columns, this is a 2D matrix but there are matrices with higher dimensions, e.g. the spin-spin correlation function can be represented by a matrix with dimensions of $[3\times 3 \times n_{mode}\times n_Q]$, which corresponds to $S^{\alpha\beta}(\omega,\textrm{Q})$, where $\alpha,\beta\in\{x,y,z\}$ and $\omega$ is indexed by the mode number of $\textbf{Q}$ is indexed on a predefined grid. Since the sequence of dimensions is not fixed by math, a representation of the spin-spin correlation function with a matrix with dimensions of $[n_{mode}\times n_Q\times 3\times 3]$ is equally valid. To minimize the guessing, each matrix is SpinW is defined such that the variable size dimensions are the rightmost. For example a list of position vectors will be stored in a matrix with dimensions of $[3\times n]$, a list of $[3\times 3]$ matrices will be stored in a matrix with dimensions of $[3\times 3\times n]$.
