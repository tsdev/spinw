**SpinW** (*spin-double-u*) is a Matlab library that can optimize magnetic structures using mean field theory and calculate spin wave dispersion and spin-spin correlation function for complex crystal and magnetic structures. For details check http://www.spinw.org

# Current Status
We are currently in a period of change. **SpinW will be moving to python/C++ (with a Matlab interface)**. I'm sure you can appreciate that this will be a lot of work as all of the code will be completely re-written and updated. In this period the Matlab version will be stabilized at v3.1.1 with bug fixes and reviewed external pull requests. More details of the new version will follow. [**For Q&A we are testing GitHub Discussions.**](https://github.com/SpinW/spinw/discussions)

# Documentation
* experimental and under construction, the address can change in the future
* documentation of the master branch
* use `swdoc`/`swhelp` instead of the Matlab built-in `doc`/`help` functions to get help on SpinW
* can be also accessed from the browser: https://spinw.github.io/spinwdoc/

# Build Status
Currently automated testing is on the `ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest` and `macos-latest` Github actions runners (Ubuntu 20.04, Windows Server 2022, macOS-11 as of 16/11/22) and the latest Matlab version available from the [setup-matlab](https://github.com/matlab-actions/setup-matlab) action (R2022b as of 16/11/22). We also test on Ubuntu 20.04 and MATLAB2020a. It should be noted that MATLAB symbolic calculation changed post R2018a and as such symbolic results may be differ with a relative tolerance of < 0.03%.

Testing can be pulled from the [testing](https://www.github.com/spinw/testing) repository and run with the `runspinwFunctionalityTests` command from the `Testing` directory.
