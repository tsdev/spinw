SWPLOT.LOGO({fName})
 
The logo is using an honest colormap (cm_inferno) and removed the tiles
of the sine wave to symbolize the increase of quality of code (measured
as a number of eliminated for loops). :D The logo will be used for SpinW
3.0. Colormap is expected to change next time when version increases to
the next integer.
 
 
Input:
 
fName     File name to save the logo. Optional, if not given the logo
          the logo will be shown in a new figure.
